# Avatar-HQ
AvatarHQ is a collection of 200 hand-drawn avatar portraits at 1024 × 1024 resolution, each identity-matched to a real face from CelebA-HQ and accompanied by a rich textual caption stored in captions.json; the repository also includes five-fold train/validation splits so you can plug the data directly into style-transfer, text-to-image or cross-modal retrieval experiments. After cloning the repo, simply drop the images/ directory and the caption file into the project root and you can iterate over samples immediately—for example, run python - <<'PY'\nimport json, random, pathlib, PIL.Image as Image\nroot = pathlib.Path('images')\nimg = random.choice(list(root.glob('*.png')))\nprint(json.loads(open('captions.json').read())[img.stem])\nImage.open(img).show()\nPY to display a random avatar and its description.
