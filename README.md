Avatar-HQ
=========

AvatarHQ is a lightweight dataset comprising three directories: `avatar/`, containing 200 hand-drawn PNG portraits at 1024 × 1024 resolution; `realistic/`, holding the identity-matched CelebA-HQ reference photographs; and `text/`, supplying concise English descriptions in plain-text files that share filename stems with the images (for example, 0001.png and 0001.txt). The collection is released for non-commercial research under the Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike 4.0 International licence (CC BY-NC-SA 4.0), while any auxiliary code in this repository is MIT-licensed—using the data implies acceptance of the CC terms, and commercial use requires written permission from the authors.
