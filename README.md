# Avatar-HQ
AvatarHQ contains three directories—avatar/ (200 high-resolution hand-drawn portraits, 1024 × 1024 PNG), realistic/ (the identity-matched CelebA-HQ reference photos), and text/ (plain-text files whose names mirror the image IDs and whose contents are concise English descriptions of the corresponding faces). Clone the repository, iterate over paired files by matching the shared filename stem (e.g., 0001.png, 0001.txt), and you can immediately run any avatar-generation, style-transfer, or text-to-image experiment without extra parsing or JSON conversion; a minimal Python example is import pathlib, random, PIL.Image as Image; root=pathlib.Path('avatar'); name=random.choice([p.stem for p in root.glob('*.png')]); print(open(f'text/{name}.txt').read().strip()); Image.open(root/f'{name}.png').show().
